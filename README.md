# List the things you added for points
I made a background which i feel should be 2 points, 1 for background implimentation, and 1 for making the art myself

I made particles for the small asteroids which should be 1 point

I made a Credits scene which i think should be 2 points, 1 for creating the scene with the text, and 1 for making more buttons across the scenes for scene movement
